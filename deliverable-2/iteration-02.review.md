# WoofWoof - Team 4

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Friday November 2nd Good meeting guys
 * Where: Morison Hall Common Room


#### Decisions that turned out well

* Using Springboot
  * Creating back-end was much easier and more streamlined
* Using Google Maps api
  * Made setting up map screen straight-forward
* Became more used to people's schedule and was more accommodating to people's schedule.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Pull Requests
  * Would have liked to do weekly builds and pull requests but we did not set this up as our work flow initially.
  * We were moving so fast that we did not have enough time to do more thorough code reviews.
* Unit Tests
  * We would have liked to create unit tests to get more coverage across the backend functions.
  * Definitely something we want to look into along with the continuous integration builds.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* Code Reviews
* Unit Tests
