# Woof-Woof | Team 10

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov 13
 * End date: Nov 30

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

* Established a more formal SDLC:
  * Now we have the core of our code base setup. We are going to have more formal code reviews and a weekly code cutoff for anything to be merged to master.

* We will be using pair programming to keep each other accountable for our responsibilities.
  * We saw this worked really effectively with the pair programming assignment.

#### Roles & responsibilities

The team kept the same roles same as before with Malavan, Tiger, and George on the back-end and Rohan, Grace, and Matthew on the front end.

In addition to our assigned roles, there were times when someone who was working on the frontend would help out someone working on the back-end and vice versa. This was necessary for times when individuals came across blockers they could not get through on there own.

#### Events

Tutorial Meetings (Monday)

* Review what everyone has accomplished over the weekend.
* Address blockers anyone might have.
* Hear feedback from TA and see how to apply this to the upcoming sprint.

Prepare for Weekend Meetings (Thursday)

* Check everyone's schedule for any upcoming deadlines not related to 301.
  * Assign tasks accordingly.
* Address blockers anyone might have with tasks assigned.
* Review any major changes/direction of the app.
* Reprioritize tasks according to any changes/discussion we have during this meeting.

#### Artifacts
 * Task board on github that keeps track of tasks that need to be done, are currently being worked on and by whom, and completed tasks
 * Group members can assign themselves to tasks after we create and update the tasks after the weekly meeetings.

#### Git / GitHub workflow
For each task we create a branch named after that task, once that task is complete a pull request is created to merge that branch with master. The code is reviewed by other teammates to ensure it is working and that it does not create other issues before being merged with master.   

We chose this workflow as it allows each group member to complete their assigned tasks independently at their own pace without having to worry about the progress of other group members. Then the completed tasks can be combined via pull requests into the master branch to build the completed thing.
