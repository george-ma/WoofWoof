# WoofWoof (Team 04)

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct 13
 * Where: BA 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 1. **Grace** and **George** agreed on using ***Basalmic*** over hand-drawing the wireframes. This in retrospect made the process a lot easier initially as well as made the wireframes modifiable for future changes.
 2. The decision to use **Ionic** for our front-end also turned out to be a great decision. We have began prototyping our project and even though it is our group's first time using Ionic, the framework's documentation is clear and it is easy to make use of our existing web dev knowledge. (for instance, we have figured out how to embed google maps into our ionic project, as well as a 'pinpoint my location' feature)

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. During the product design/planning meetings, everyone had great ideas about the big features we would implement in the app, but brushed aside some minor details(e.g. how event creation works/looks). As the mockups were being made, we realized that those left out minor details had influence over how our app would function and look, so we had to all meet up again and make clarifications.

2. In the earlier meetings, we did not have a full grasp on everyone's schedules, and some team members had prior appointments at the time we decided to meet. We moved some dates around, and voice called for members not physically present.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* For the future, we want to be more flexible with our meeting times.
  * We did not take into account that people had other priorities (other course, personal lives).

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

> * From most to least important.
> * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
> * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

* Mockups for the frontend were made so coding can begin right away.
* Experimented and became familiar with the Google Maps API integration with Ionic.
  * This was not part of the original iteration plan but it was essential to the upcoming development since the GoogleMap API is the core of the project.
* Agreed on team roles.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

> * From most to least important.
> * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.   
> e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

* Did not setup the Trello but will get that done before the next tutorial team meeting.
  * We did not set this up since it was not the priority at the time.
* Did not figure out how we will get user feedback (dog owners/dog enthusiests).
  * We will figure this out near the end of building the MVP.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Since we now have a solid understanding of each members schedule, we have planned out how we want to breakdown our agile development practices.
  * We will meet on our tutorial (Monday night) to review what each member did over the weekend. From there, we will assign new tasks, voice any problems members are having, talk to the TA, etc.
  * On our Thursday afternoon meeting, we will all meet up to check in our progress since Monday, and assign new work as needed.

* 2 - 4 items
* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
* Can be related to product and/or process.
