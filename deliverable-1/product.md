#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 * Dog meetup application for organizing play-dates between dog owners and non dog owners.
 * Cross-platform progressive web application built using Ionic.

##### Examples:
**Dog owner searching for dog play- dates with other dog owners**
* Would use app to search for public events
* Would use app to organize public events.
* Would use app to be invited to private events.
* Would use app to organize private events.

**Non dog owner searching for dog play-dates**
* Would use app to search to search and attend public events.
* Would use app to be invited to private events.
* Would use app to view profiles of other dog owners.

**The mock-ups of the UI are committed in the `mockups` Directory**

#### Q2: Who are your target users?
 * Dog owners
	 * Looking for events.
	 * Looking to organize dog play dates.
	 * Looking to meet other dog owners.
 * Non-dog owners looking for dogs to pet
	 * Looking to meet dog owners and other dog enthusiast.
	 * Looking to organize events to meet other dogs..

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
* A lot of dog owners know that interactions with other dogs is good for their dogs mental health.
* There are also benefits for non-dog owners as well as short-term dog exposure has been proven in medical studies to have physiological and psychosocial events.
* Non-dog owners also are interested in meeting other dog owners and learning new insight about their dogs.
* Non-dog owners would also like to know where and when dog owners are gathering so they can go see and play with dogs.
* Before this, dog owners would occasionally run into each other at off leash dog parks or I've seen instances where condo boards would organize events for dog owners of the condo.
  * None of the methods shown above make it easy or convenient for dog owners and non dog owners to find good play dates.
  * Our app would quickly allow owners to create community meetups in a fraction of a time it would take to normally organize/advertise these same meetups

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings and/or collaborative process.

* We were considering not using Ionic (and using Android Studio instead),
however, since none of our group members have mobile experience we decided to just do a progressive web-app using Ionic instead. (as some of us have web experience, or are currently taking csc309)

* In our discussions, we came upon the idea that users need to sign up and construct a valid profile before viewing the main interface of our app. The thought behind this is to keep the community of dog owners tight-knit, and potentially interactive. 

* Additionally, we are considering to create a 'forum' section in our app similar to Instagram discovery- this however will not be part of our second iteration (not part of our minimal viable product). A forum page will allow dog owners to easily communicate with a group of trusted users who are all passionate about their dogs. This will not only help dog owners to discover more members of the community, but potentially provide advice and guidance for any new dog owners.

* There were also discussions about viewer/user visibility; for now, all profiles will be public, everyone will be able to see who checked-in to a park, and everyone's events will be made public.
